## Introduction and a little defintion of Steganography
Steganography is a technique used to hide the information, and Steganalysis is the technique of detecting the hidden information, the internet and all kinds of open communications are using the steganography technique to hide files, videos, messages and images inside other files, to eliminating any user in open internet from confidential information, but the Cybercriminals tunnel their data to devices using different methodologies. A typical endpoint antimalware ðŸ¦  tools are not designed search for the hidden info, so detecting the hidden data is not an easy way. The technique facilitates the ease transmit data for cybercriminals. This paper is considering to review various steganalysis tools and the antivirus ðŸ¦  programs working together in real-time to provide more confidentiality to data. And shows a proof of concept for one of the steganalysis tools.

I am trying to build a first algorithm to detect Steganography ðŸ¦  using AI ðŸ”¬
